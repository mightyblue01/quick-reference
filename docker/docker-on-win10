Steps:
(1) Pre-requisites- Enable Virtualization support in BIOS, enable 'Hyper-V' support in "Windows features"
(2) Install Docker for Windows on Windows 10 pro/enterprise. Doesn't work in Home edition
(3) Enable "Expose daemon without TLS" option 

Troubleshooting:
In case Docker doesn't start after step 2, execute following command and reboot the machine - 
bcdedit /set HypervisorLaunchType auto
