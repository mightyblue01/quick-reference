(1) Install the all-spark-notebook as follows -
    docker run -d -p 8888:8888 jupyter/all-spark-notebook 
                  OR
    docker pull jupyter/all-spark-notebook

(2) Spawn the docker container out of the image (if image is downloaded using "pull" command) -
    docker run -dit img-name 
        
(3) To access from local host machine, get into the docker container- 
    docker exec -it <mycontainer> bash

(4) Now, inside the container, generate the config file 
    jupyter notebook --generate-config  (generates config file at ~/.jupyter/)
(5) Open jupyter config file(jupyter_notebook_config.py) and enable following for open access (to access from anywhere without any token or password)
    
    c.NotebookApp.ip = '*
    c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
    c.NotebookApp.port = 8888
    c.NotebookApp.token = ''
    c.NotebookApp.password = ''
